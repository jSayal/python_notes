# Required study topics

As I am learning Python, I am leaving some topics and details behind. The biggest reason for this is that I do not have knowledge to understand these topics completely. But as I get more experienced with Python, I can study these topics and understand them. 

1. The builtin type obj and isinstance() method **PAGE 41**
2. [itertools in python](https://realpython.com/python-itertools/)
3. Symbol table in Python, symtable module in Python and use symbol table in interpreters and compilers in computer science (use wikipedia).
4. Study Python packages in detail. Sources are (a) [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/modules.html) (b) [Real Python Article](https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/modules.html)
