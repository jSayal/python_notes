# Object oriented programming

I will not go into lot of detail of what is Object Oriented Programming and what is an object and other related to OOP, as I have see this stuff many times. In this chapter, main focus is syntax of OOP in Python.

Python has a lot of builtin types like `int, str, list etc`. and it also allows programmers to create their own types. Using class `keyword` we can create our own type.
